Parsons puzzles can be written in such a way that alters the difficulty, 
and this can assist with differentiation in the classroom to cater for a variety of abilities.

<h4 class="my-4">Level 1: Basic</h4>
Code is out of order, but contains no syntax errors. When reordered, will be an optimal solution to the problem. No indentation.

<h4 class="my-4">Level 2: Basic + Indentation</h4>
Out of order, but contains no syntax errors. Indentation required. Also called 2D Parsonâ€™s Puzzles.

<h4 class="my-4">Level 3: Distractors</h4>
Code is out of order, may or may not require indentation, and also includes distractors - deliberately incorrect code.

<h4 class="my-4">Level 4: Indentation + Random Noise</h4>
Code is out of order and contains unrelated random noise.
